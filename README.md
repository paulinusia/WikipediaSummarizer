# WikipediaSummarizer

This project takes a subject that is input by the user and returns a wikipedia webpage.
It then processes the webpage and removes all unnecessary details, focusing only on the paragraphs and images.
It shows the user an image of the subject and preprocesses the given text. Once the text is processed the program puts weights
on the words accordingly and displays the main idea points in a Cloud Text.
The program then givens the user a 10 sentence summary on the topic they chose based on these weights.
